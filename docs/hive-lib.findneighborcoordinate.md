Find the first neighboring hex coordinate for which a predicate holds true.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export declare function findNeighborCoordinate(board: GameBoard, coordinate: HexCoordinate, predicate: StackFn): HexCoordinate | undefined;
```

**Returns:**

[HexCoordinate](./hive-lib.hexcoordinate.md) \| undefined

the first hex coordinate for which predicate returns true or undefined if the predicate never evaluates to true.

## Remarks

No guarantees are made regarding which neighboring coordinate is returned if predicate evaluates to true for multiple neighboring coordinates.
