## Remarks

The pillbug has a special ability that allows it to move an adjacent piece two space; up onto itself and then down into another space adjacent to itself, with the following exceptions (which are enforced by this function): - The pillbug may not move a piece from a stack with more than one tile. - The pillbug may not move a piece if it would break the hive. - The pillbug may not move a piece through a gate.

Additionally, the following rules apply to the pillbug but are \*not\* enforced by this function: - The pillbug may not move a piece which was just moved or placed by another player. - Any piece moved by the pillbug may not be moved at all during the next player's turn.
