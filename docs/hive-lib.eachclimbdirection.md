## eachClimbDirection() function

Call iteratee for every neighboring stack onto which a tile could climb.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export declare function eachClimbDirection(board: GameBoard, coordinate: HexCoordinate, iteratee: NeighborFn): boolean;
```

</td><td>

A game board.

[HexCoordinate](./hive-lib.hexcoordinate.md)


</td><td>

The coordinate whose neighbors will be iterated over.

iteratee

[NeighborFn](./hive-lib.neighborfn.md)


</td><td>

The function invoked per iteration.


</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
**Returns:**

boolean

false if the iteration ended early, true otherwise. If there is no stack at the given coordinate, true is returned.

## Remarks

The following conditions must be met for a tile to be able to climb onto a neighboring stack (and are checked by this iterator): - The height of the destination stack must be equal to or greater than the height of the source stack. - There must not be a gate between the source and destination coordinates.

Iteratee functions may exit iteration early by explicitly returning false.
