## Remarks

The mosquito rules state that the mosquito takes on the movement characteristics of any bug it touches, regardless of color. If moved as a beetle on top of the hive, it continues to move as a beetle until it climbs down from the hive. If when on the ground level it is next to a stacked beetle, it may move as a beetle and not any piece below the beetle. If only touching another mosquito (including a stacked one) and no other piece, it may not move.
