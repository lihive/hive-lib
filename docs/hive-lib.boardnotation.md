## Remarks

A game board notation string is a simple compressed string representation of the result of passing the board into `JSON.stringify`<!-- -->. The opening and closing brackets are replaced with URL-safe characters and tiles are assumed to be white unless explicitly noted as black. Finally, extraneous characters are omitted and a simple change to the first and last characters of the string are made to simplify parsing. Note that board notation is not intended to be human-readable; rather, it's optimized for size and potential use in a URL.
